# Bevy Survival Crafting

A work in progress survival crafting game in [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

Currently in active development with placeholder graphics. Move with WASD, pickup with Space, and craft an Axe with E. Follows the bevy tutorial series at [LogicProjects on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7v3YEDa603x_84PgCPytzA)

Yes please! Any issues, bug fixes, code style fixes are welcome.  This is intended to be an educational project and I'm hoping it's a good example of using bevy to make a simple game.
